# Hexcellent Improbability

The name is a vaguely hidden tribute to Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams.

## Once upon a time...

There was a much younger me, so young that I lived in the previous millenium 
(a statement which would be scary in a 100 years time...).

At the time, which I think might be somewhere around 1992 I taught kids aged
14/15ish (8th to 10th grade) the basic use of computers, that is, text processing,
the use of drawing/painting programs etc.

Some of them expressed the desire to create games, which luckily is a broad subject.

To cater for this desire I used TurboPascal/TurboVision for creating a system I 
endearingly named "Eventyr Sjov" (Adventurous Fun), which could be used to create
games along the same princpiles as in the the books "Sv√¶rd og Troldom" (Fighting Fantasy).

I recently (again) came across the manual (it was probably written in Word 2.0 - a 
PDF (Danish only) is available in the doc folder) and decided I would try to see if I could
create something similar, but this time in the browser. 

This is the feeble steps in that direction.
